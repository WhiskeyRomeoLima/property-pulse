For VS Code, you can force it to display the parent folder name next to the file name in the tab.

So if you have a file "/customers/page.tsx" it will display "page.tsx customers" in the tab.

To achieve this:

File -> Preferences -> Settings
Search "workbench.editor.labelFormat"
In the dropdown option select "short"
